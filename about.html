        <h2>Achievements</h2>
    <p>
        Andrade is the first Brazilian female gymnast to medal at an Olympic Games and only the second Brazilian woman to win a gold medal at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. Andrade is one of only 11 female gymnasts to have medalled on every event in the history of World Championships, and one of only three gymnasts to have done so in the 21st century, alongside Simone Biles and Aliya Mustafina.<cite>"Rebeca Andrade."

        </p>
        <p>""I talk a lot with my therapist, and I try to take care of my mind and my body to the best of my abilities to create the balance I need to perform very calmly, without pressure, without feeling an obligation to bring medals back home. My job is just to compete, and I do it because I love it and because I want it. People tell me I look peaceful and serene [during competition]. That’s because I’m there doing my job, like every other human being has their job to do. We can only hope to do our share and work our hardest to try to achieve the results we want."– <cite>WAG.

            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
                Rebeca Andrade—a Panasonic GREEN IMPACT ambassador
        2022 world all-round champion and history-making gymnast Rebeca Andrade is the first Brazilian woman to win Olympic gold in her sport. Like many among the so-called Generation Z—roughly those aged between 12 and 25—she is passionate about protecting the environment. <cite>"Panasonic Accelerates Its Smart City Initiatives." Panasonic Newsroom, September 26, 2023. Accessed October 9, 2024. https://news.panasonic.com/global/stories/14349.</cite></p></p>

        <p>
        Many of the participants admitted that ESG in particular was a new concept for them. Said Rebeca: “When I first read about ESG, it took me a while to understand the meaning of each of the letters. But once you understand them, it gets easier to know how you can put the ideas behind them into practice.” <cite>Receba</cite><cite>"Panasonic Accelerates Its Smart City Initiatives." Panasonic Newsroom, September 26, 2023. Accessed October 9, 2024. https://news.panasonic.com/global/stories/14349.</cite></p>

        <p>
        One of the influencers helpfully explained that ESG is basically a new way of defining sustainability. “The ‘E’ aspect is about companies minimizing the impact they have on the local environment; the ‘S’ part is about companies paying attention to the social needs of their local communities.” She added, “The ‘G’ aspect—governance—is a new perspective; it’s about companies making their sustainability efforts more transparent to their shareholders and encouraging other companies in their supply chain to embrace sustainability.”
